npm **Node Sass Installation**

To use Node Sass, you must first install it. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g node-sass
```

This will install Node Sass globally, meaning that it will be available to use from any directory on your computer.

**Creating a Sass File**

Once you have installed Node Sass, you can create a Sass file. Sass files have the `.scss` extension. In this example, we will create a file called `style.scss`.

```scss
/* This is a Sass file. */

body {
  background-color: black;
}
```

**Compiling the Sass File**

To compile the Sass file, you can use the `node-sass` command. This command will take the Sass file as input and produce a CSS file as output. In this example, we will compile the `style.scss` file to a file called `style.css`.

```bash
node-sass editing/style.scss editing/style.css
```

This will produce a `style.css` file that contains the following CSS:

```css
/* This is the CSS file that was generated from the Sass file. */

body {
  background-color: black;
}
```

**Watching the Sass File for Changes**

If you want to automatically compile the Sass file whenever you make changes to it, you can use the `-w` flag with the `node-sass` command. This will cause the `node-sass` command to watch the Sass file for changes and automatically recompile it whenever it is modified.

```bash
node-sass -w editing/style.scss editing/style.css
```

This will keep the `style.css` file up-to-date with the latest changes to the `style.scss` file.

**Using the Compiled CSS File**

Once you have compiled the Sass file, you can use the compiled CSS file in your HTML document. To do this, you can add the following line to the `<head>` section of your HTML document:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```

This will cause the browser to load the `style.css` file and apply the styles to your HTML document.

**Conclusion**

Node Sass is a powerful tool that can be used to compile Sass files into CSS files. This
